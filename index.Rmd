# Now, I will show the result of the Homework 4 about Q_2

Loading the package and datasets
```{r,setup,include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(flexdashboard)
library(p8105.datasets)

data("instacart")
set.seed(123)

# Randomly sample 5000 rows to improve rendering speed
instacart_samp <- instacart |> sample_n(5000)
```


# Scatter Plot: Hour vs Add-to-Cart (Interactive scatter plot)


```{r}

# Box Plot: Distribution of Add-to-Cart Order by Department

```{r}

# Bar Chart: Most Frequent Aisles Ordered From

```{r, warning=FALSE}
