# Now, I will show the result of the Homework 4 about Q_2

Loading the package and datasets
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(flexdashboard)
library(p8105.datasets)

```
Cleaning the datasets and summary
```{r}
# 加载数据
data("instacart")

# 为了渲染速度，对明细做适度抽样（可按需调大/调小）
set.seed(1)
instacart_samp <- instacart %>% sample_n(20000)

# 星期标签（原数据 dow 为 0~6）
dow_levels <- c("Sun","Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat")
instacart_samp <- instacart_samp %>%
  mutate(
    order_dow = factor(order_dow, levels = 0:6, labels = dow_levels),
    reordered = factor(reordered, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("First time","Reordered"))
  )
```
